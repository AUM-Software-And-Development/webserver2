OSI:
The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model 
that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a 
telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying 
internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of 
diverse communication systems with standard protocols. The model 
partitions a communication system into abstraction layers. The original 
version of the model defined seven layers.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) 
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) 
Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX)

HTTP communication usually takes place over TCP/IP connections. 
The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used. 
(HTTPS is 443)
This does not preclude HTTP from being implemented on top of any 
other protocol on the Internet, or on other networks. HTTP only presumes 
a reliable transport; any protocol that provides such guarantees can 
be used; the mapping of the HTTP/1.1 request and response structures 
onto the transport data units of the protocol in question is outside 
the scope of this specification.

RFC = request for comments, kind of like the W3

The official source for RFCs on the World Wide Web is the RFC Editor.
Some of the standardized RFCs are:
HTTP/1.1 →Initially it is RFC 2616 but later replaced by RFC 7230, 
RFC 7231, RFC 7232, RFC 7233, RFC 7234, RFC 7235. So, we need to read 
from RFC 7230 to RFC 7235 to implement basic workings of HTTP.
HTTP/2 → RFC 7540 and RFC 7541
FTP → RFC959
So, if we want to implement HTTP server, we have to read their 
particular RFC which is RFC 7230, RFC 7231, RFC 7232, RFC 7233, RFC 7234, 
RFC 7235.

Address family:

AF_INET (IP), AF_INET6 (IPv6), AF_UNIX (local channel, similar to pipes)
AF_ISO (ISO protocols), and AF_NS (Xerox Network Systems protocols)

Type:

SOCK_STREAM (virtual circuit service), SOCK_DGRAM (datagram service), 
SOCK_RAW (direct IP service)

Protocol:
index for variations in the header file
